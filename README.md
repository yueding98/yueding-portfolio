## About Me
Hi, I'm Yue Ding in the MSPPM program. 

## What I hope to learn
I want to learn how to create impressive and clean graphs to show data in a story-telling way. 

## Portfolio

Data for the government debt analysis is from OECD. Visit [here](dataviz2.md) to get visualization for government debt analysis.
