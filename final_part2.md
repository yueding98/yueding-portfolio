# Part 2 Wireframe and User Research
## Introduction
For user research, I will apply Shorthand to create a draft of my final project, showing my audience a basic idea of what the project will look like and get more useful information to improve it. 

I built some data visualization using Tableau and Flourish to presents the audience in the user research to give them a more specific image of the visualization effects. 

Here is my wireframe built by [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/NE6TjiPP2bE6Q50o). It basically includes some text and rough graphs created by Tableau and Flourish. Using Shorthand to build a story framework is not as easy as I expected. I am still trying to find a better way to present the logic of the story especially it's not an interesting topic.

## User Research Protocol
### Target Audience
The target audience of my story is policy-makers from China, as well as academic researchers and the public who are interested in the Chinese industrial and R&D policy. 
Therefore, in general, the purpose of this data visualization is to inform policy-makers of the gap between China and other countries on R&D input and output, and help them make decisions to improve the technology and innovation. For academic researchers and public, this project is expected to draw their attention to this field and make them think about the approches to improve. 

### Interviewee Selection
Considering the target audience, I identified three users with relevant but different background to participate in this research.

User A: Male public policy master student, 28 years old, focusing on Chinese industrial policy, with some data visualization and much R&D studying experience

User B: Female politics phd student, 25 years old, studying China-US high-tech and industrial policy, with little data analytics but much global industrial policy studying experience

User C: Female business student, 25 years old, expertising in VC and investment, with some data visualization and technology market research experience

### Interview Script

The most important thing I want to focus on in the user research is whether the data visualzation makes sense to the target audience. I will evaluate it according to the following aspects:

#### Intuitiveness 
(Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information?)

What do you think the graph is talking about?

#### Completeness 
(Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable?)

Do you think the graph can support the main idea of this part/the entire topic?

#### Engagement
(Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic?)

What new idea do you have after reading this visualization?

## Feedback
### Graph 1 to 3: 
|Question|User A| B | C |
|--|--|--|--|
|What do you think the graph is talking about?|Global comparison of R&D spending. |Gross domestic spending on R&D by percent and total millions of dollars of some top countries. | Spending on R&D in 2019 in a global perspective, and trends of R&D spending by year of the top 5 countries. |
|Do you think the graph can support the main idea of this part/the entire topic?|Yes, it gives a comprehensive overview at the very beginning to show the global comparison of countries. |Yes, for me it works. |The first global map is a little tricky for me. It is not complete and comparable. And the second bar chart consist of too many country unnecessarily. |
|What new idea do you have after reading this visualization?|I notice that US is always the country that has the most spending on R&D, and China just follows behind and increases very fast. I am looking forward to more details on these two countries. |I am curious about the spending by sectors and research types in order to analyze the potential policies.|Spending of China grows so fast for the past decades, and I want to know if there is any possibility to reach the level of US.|

### Graph 4:
|Question| User A| User B | User C |
|--|--|--|--|
|What do you think the graph is talking about?| The comparison of China and US in the past 20 years, as well as the research types. | Comparing the spending of China and US, I can see the gap between the two countries in details. | Comparison of US and China by the research type. |
|Do you think the graph can support the main idea of this part/the entire topic?| I think so, it's obvious to see the gap between China and US, not only for the total value, but also for each category. |My concern is whether the measure unit is the same for the two country though it lools make sense. I think it would be better to make is clear. |I find it's hard to compare each stack except the experimental development.|
|What new idea do you have after reading this visualization?|Does this input gap reflect any output result? By now we only focus on the spending gap, but as audience, I want to go further to reveal the result of the spending input. |China has more input in experimental development than US while for another two types it falls behind. What is the role of applied and basic research, and how do these types contribute to the innovation and technology development? |What is the difference of applied research, basic research and experimental development? And what is the importance of each of them in practice? I am wondering why we focus on the comparison by research type|

### Overview
|User A|User B|User C|
|--|--|--|
|The topic is serious and boring if you only focus on the facts and the data. I think you can put more pictures and informative figures or words into your work to make it attractive. | I believe your project can be very useful for our academic researcher on this field. It also gives me a good example to apply data visualization to my essay and research report in the future. My advice for it is to deep into the fact behind the data rather than just presenting what you have. | The visualization is clear, which will be appreciated in business. In my opinion, you can highlight some significant data to emphasize the importance to the audience. Because there is so much data and the audience can be lost if there is no guide or highlight. |

## Plan to Improve
Taking all feedback into consideration, I plan to improve my final project in the following points.
#### 1. Add an graph to show the output of R&D. 
The interviewees thought that just showing the gap and comparison is not powerful to make any useful decision. So I consider to add a graph to visualize the comparison of patent, which can be regarded as an aspect of the output of R&D. 
#### 2. Add more words to make the terms clear and comprehensive.
In order to be understandable, especially for the public and policy-makers who are not very familiar with this topic, it would be better if I give some narrative and vivid explanations of this topic and the metric method. 
#### 3. Highlight some important numbers to attract the audience's attention.
I agree with what user A and C said, that highlighting the numbers outside the graph can work well to attract the audience to think and to guide the story. 
#### 4. Remove unnecessary elements
I was trying to show as much as information as I could in the first part of cross nation overview. But it seems that it is of need to show too much information which can cause some unclear and misleading problem. 
#### 5. Come up with practical call and policy on this analysis
I am still thinking about the call and suggestion at the end of the project. It's a high-level work and I need to ask for advice from people who expertise at this topic to make it feasible and reasonable.
