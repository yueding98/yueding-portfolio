# Visualization 1: OECD original data
OECD data visualization in general:

# Visualization 2: Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio by Country
Here is the grid graph of government debt-to-GDP ratio by countries from 1995 to 2019:

# Visualization 3: Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio by Year
Here is the column chart of government debt-to-GDP ratio by year from 1995 to 2021. You can select the target year to see the debt-to-GDP ratio for different countries. Each graph is sorted by the raio, so it's easy to identify the country with the highest debt-to-GDP ratio.

# Brief Summary
For visualization 2, the x-axis is about the year, so the line charts can be used to show the time trends, while in the visualization 1 and 3, the x-axis of countries can be visualized using the bar/column chart. I only apply one color in both visualization 2 and 3 because we don't need to use colors to highlight or distinguish, which make graphs clear. 
I design the third data visualiztion to find the level of debt of countries in each year. Flourish provides an interactive way to show graphs by year by selecting the year in a sorting bar. Then I sort the graph by values of debt-to-GDP, so the audience can find the highest and lowest for each year immediately.
