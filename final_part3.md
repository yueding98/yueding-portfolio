# Part 3: Putting it All Together
In the previous work, I wireframed the data story in Shorthand and drafted some data visualization using Tableau. Then I got the feedback from both user research and Professor and TA's comments. In the last preparation assignment, I put it all together to modify and redesign my final project to tell a complete story about R&D in China with informative words and graphs. Here is the summary of how I create the final complete project taking all into consideration. You can check the final project [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/r-d-in-china-now-and-future/index.html).

### Rethink of the target audience
Both user research and Professor and TA comments mentioned that the target audience is vague and unclear. So I specify the audience as well as the topic in this part. The target audience of this project is policy-makers from China's Department of Science and Technology, and stakeholders from business and academic institutions. My project is to introduce the current situation of China's R&D, and come up with policy recommendations for the future improvement.

### Improve the design based on the feedback
#### Intuitiveness
One of the feedbacks saying that a comparison with detail between countries is expected. So I consider to add this part to the “conflict”, which is finding the gap and problems by comparing China to the US, the country that has the top R&D spending. 
I also cut down the number of country in the first section when showing the spendings of the world. I agree that it makes no sense and isn’t helpful at all to present information as much as possible. 

#### Completeness
Some feedbacks state that users are confused about the basic, applied research and experimental development. Comments from professor and TA also point out that the final graph which is the comparison of China and US can tell more stories. To make the topic more specific, I decide to draw attention to the structure of funds, which is, where are the funds from and where are they going. 

#### Storytelling logic
Some feedbacks and comments from professor and TA point out that the current wireframe feels like a collection of graphs all about very similar things. So one of the most important work is to specify these questions: why I am talking about China’s R&D expenditures, why it worths attention, and what the audience could do. In the next section, I will wrap up with a final logic.  

### Finalize the project
Taking all things mentioned above into consideration, I finally organize the project following this logic: 

1.Cross nation overview: show the audience the R&D spendings of countries over the world. Then narrow the scope, point out the top 5 countries and their trends over the decades. Find out that China is the second-largest R&D expenditure country with a rapid growth in recent years.

2.Use of funds: deep into the structure of R&D funds and its use. Compare the use of funds within the country, as well as with other country like the US. Point out the “conflict” where it could improve. 

3.Policy recommendation: According to the “conflict” talked above, come up with policy proposals to improve the current situation and close the gap. 

Besides Tableau, I found that it's efficient to show the source of funds and its use with alluvial graph. So I applied the tool RAWGraphs to create alluvial graphs. It's very interpretable and understandable. 

### Wrap-up
The whole design work requires so many thoughts and concerns. I feel very excited to see my project finally works though the preparation work is very complicated and kind of boring. But I really enjoy the whole process to create a project from zero, and realize that data story is not only about data and design, but also about communication.
