## About Me
Hi, I'm Yue Ding, graduate student from MSPPM program at CMU. Before coming to CMU, I studied international political economy and worked on global risk analysis at a consulting firm. During my graduage study, I mainly focus on the data analytics and machine learning skills.

## What I hope to learn
The ability to tell stories with data is crucial important for a data analyst. I want to learn how to create impressive graphs to show data in a story-telling way, and how to use visualization to support the policy analysis. In my previous experience, I always failed to combine data with words, so my analysis was not strong and clear enough. That's why I would like to learn some skills to tell a story, specially supported by data.

## Portfolio
Here is where all my work of data visualization will go. You can also get access to it by the [link](https://yueding98.github.io/yueding-portfolio/). 

### Data Visualization of Government Debt
This is a basic visualization of the government debt. Data used in this project is from OECD. Visit [here](dataviz2.md) to get visualization for government debt analysis.

### Visualization Critique and Redesign
[Here](viz_critic_redesign.md) is my critique and redesign idea to the newly registered electric cars of EU countries in 2020.

### Final Project
In this project, I introduce the current situation of China's R&D expenditures, by comparing to countries around the world, and the insight of where the expenditures are going. Accordingly, I propose three policy recommendations to improve the strategy and close the gap in the future. 

#### Part 1
[Here](project_part1_yueding.md) is my part 1 preparation for the final project, an initial outline for the story telling of spending on R&D. 

#### Part 2
[Here](final_part2.md) is my part 2 preparation for the final project, a user research report on the wireframe of R&D spending. 

#### Part 3
[Here](final_part3.md) is the last part of the preparation for the final project, a description about how I narrow the topic, specify the target audience and finalize the project. 

#### Final Project
[Here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/r-d-in-china-now-and-future/index.html) is the project published using Shorthand.
