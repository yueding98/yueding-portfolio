# Part 2 Wireframe and User Research
## Introduction
For user research, I will apply Shorthand to create a draft of my final project, showing my audience a basic idea of what the project will look like and get more useful information to improve it. 

I built some data visualization using Tableau and Flourish to presents the audience in the user research to give them a more specific image of the visualization effects. 

Here is my wireframe built by Shorthand. It basically includes some text and rough graphs created by Tableau and Flourish. Using Shorthand to build a story framework is not as easy as I expected. I am still trying to find a better way to present the logic of the story especially it's not an interesting topic.

## User Research Protocol
### Target Audience
The target audience of my story is policy-makers from China, as well as academic researchers and the public who are interested in the Chinese industrial and R&D policy. 
Therefore, in general, the purpose of this data visualization is to inform policy-makers of the gap between China and other countries on R&D input and output, and help them make decisions to improve the technology and innovation. For academic researchers and public, this project is expected to draw their attention to this field and make them think about the approches to improve. 

### Interviewee Selection
Considering the target audience, I identified three users with relevant but different background to participate in this research.

User A: Male public policy master student, 28 years old, focusing on Chinese industrial policy, with some data visualization and much R&D studying experience

User B: Female politics phd student, 25 years old, studying China-US high-tech and industrial policy, with little data analytics but much global industrial policy studying experience

User C: Female business student, 25 years old, expertising in VC and investment, with some data visualization and technology market research experience

### Interview Script

The most important thing I want to focus on in the user research is whether the data visualzation makes sense to the target audience. I will evaluate it according to the following aspects:

#### Intuitiveness 
(Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information?)

What do you think the graph is talking about?

#### Completeness 
(Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable?)

Do you think the graph can support the main idea of this part/the entire topic?

#### Engagement
(Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic?)

What new idea do you have after reading this visualization?

## Feedback
### Graph 1 to 3: 
|Question|User A| B | C |
|--|--|--|--|
|What do you think the graph is talking about?|Global comparison of R&D spending. |Gross domestic spending on R&D by percent and total millions of dollars of some top countries. | Spending on R&D in 2019 in a global perspective, and trends of R&D spending by year of the top 5 countries. |
|Do you think the graph can support the main idea of this part/the entire topic?|Yes, it gives a comprehensive overview at the very beginning to show the global comparison of countries. |Yes, for me it works. |The first global map is a little tricky for me. It is not complete, and not comparable. |
|What new idea do you have after reading this visualization?|I notice that US is always the country that has the most spending on R&D, and China just follows behind and increases very fast. I am looking forward to more details on these two countries. |I am curious about the spending by sectors and research types in order to analyze the potential policies.|Spending of China grows so fast for the past decades, and I want to know if there is any possibility to reach the level of US.|

### Graph 4:
|Question|User A| User B | User C |
|--|--|--|--|
|What do you think the graph is talking about?| The comparison of China and US in the past 20 years, as well as the research types. | Comparing the spending of China and US, I can see the gap between the two countries in details. | Comparison of US and China by the research type. |
|Do you think the graph can support the main idea of this part/the entire topic?| I think so, it's obvious to see the gap between China and US, and |||
