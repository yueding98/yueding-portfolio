# Part 3: Putting it All Together
In the previous work, I wireframed the data story in Shorthand and drafted some data visualization using Tableau. Then I got the feedback from both user research and Professor and TA's comments. In the last preparation assignment, I put it all together to modify and redesign my final project to tell a complete story about R&D in China with informative words and graphs. Here is the summary of how I create the final complete project taking all into consideration. 

### Rethink of the target audience
Both user research and Professor and TA comments mentioned that the target audience is vague and unclear. So I specify the audience as well as the topic in this part. The target audience of this project is policy-makers from China's Department of Science and Technology, and stakeholders from business and academic institutions. My project is to introduce the current situation of China's R&D, and come up with policy recommendations for the future improvement.

### Improve the design based on the feedback


### Finalize the project
Taking all things mentioned above into consideration, I finally organize the project following this logic: 

1.Cross nation overview: show the audience the R&D spendings of countries over the world. Then narrow the scope, point out the top 5 countries and their trends over the decades. Find out that China is the second-largest R&D expenditure country with a rapid growth in recent years.

2.Use of funds: deep into the structure of R&D funds and its use. Compare the use of funds within the country, as well as with other country like the US. Point out the “conflict” where it could improve. 

3.Policy recommendation: According to the “conflict” talked above, come up with policy proposals to improve the current situation and close the gap.
