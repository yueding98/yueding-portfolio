# Part 2 Wireframe and User Research
## Introduction
For user research, I will apply Shorthand to create a draft of my final project, showing my audience a basic idea of what the project will look like and get more useful information to improve it. 

I built some data visualization using Tableau and Flourish to presents the audience in the user research to give them a more specific image of the visualization effects. 

Here is my wireframe built by Shorthand. It basically includes some text and rough graphs created by Tableau and Flourish. Using Shorthand to build a story framework is not as easy as I expected. I am still trying to find a better way to present the logic of the story especially it's not an interesting topic.

## User Research Protocol
### Target Audience
The target audience of my story is policy-makers from China, as well as academic researchers and the public who are interested in the Chinese industrial and R&D policy. 
Therefore, in general, the purpose of this data visualization is to inform policy-makers of the gap between China and other countries on R&D input and output, and help them make decisions to improve the technology and innovation. For academic researchers and public, this project is expected to draw their attention to this field and make them think about the approches to improve. 

### Interviewee Selection
Considering the target audience, I identified three users with relevant but different background to participate in this research.

User A: Male public policy master student, 28 years old, focusing on Chinese industrial policy, with some data visualization and much R&D studying experience
User B: Female politics phd student, 25 years old, studying China-US high-tech and industrial policy, with little data analytics but much global industrial policy studying experience
User C: Female business student, 25 years old, expertising in VC and investment, with some data visualization and technology market research experience
